        Q-1:Discuss the scope of var, let, and const. <br />
        Answer:
        <br />
        *** var is a functional scope. var can access only in function scope and
        before declaration we can access it.It is hoisting to the top position
        in function or global scope.we can change its value in functional scope.

        <br />

        *** let is a block scope that means we can access it inside the curly
        brackets{}.
