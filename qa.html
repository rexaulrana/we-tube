        <h2>Question:1</h2>
        <h4>Discuss the scope of var, let, and const.</h4>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <span>
          <h5>var</h5>
          is a functional scope. var can access only in function scope and
          before declaration we can access it.It is hoisting to the top position
          in function or global scope.we can change, reassign and update its
          value in functional scope.

          <br />

          <h5>let</h5>
          let is a block scope that means we can access it inside the curly
          brackets{}.we can reassign its value inside curly brackets.

          <br />
          ***const is a block scope as like let. But the difference is const is
          fixed variable that means we can not reassign its value.

        <h2>Question:2</h2>
        <h4>Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h4>
        <h5>Answer:</h5>
        <span>
          <h5>null</h5>
          null means there is no value for this variable.when we declare a
          variable and its value is empty then we set its value "null"
          <br />
          <h5>undefined</h5>
          undefined means where something not defined but that is important. we
          get undefined in many ways.Here are some ways: 1.When we declare a
          variable and we forget to set its value then we get undefined. 2.when
          we declare a function and we use data from the function but we forget
          to return the data inside the function then we get undefined.If we
          write return word without what we return then we get undefined. 3.when
          we want to access a property from an object but the property isn't
          there then we get undefined. 4.when we want to access an element of an
          array by index but the index no is longer than the array or the index
          is not available in array then we get undefined.
